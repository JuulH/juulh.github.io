## Overview

> *In the end they have reached the core. You represent our final struggle. Push against endless and overwhelming odds. Overcome your limits, your fears and ascend.*

A VR experience pushing the boundaries of your spatial awareness by pitting you against swarms of enemies from all sides. Deflect, Dodge and Defend what is yours - if you fail, the very ground you stand upon will crumble as it leaves you with less and less. If you succeed, ascend a step further towards salvation.

This game was entirely created with the Mantis Engine, our custom C++ VR engine using OpenXR.

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about programming languages, compilers, Unreal Engine & working in large codebases.

- By building a programming language, compiler & interpreter from scratch I've demystified how these tools work in the tools I use day-to-day. I've learnt more about call stacks, call frames, assembly & data types.
- Making a custom C++ plugin for Unreal Engine has taught me more about UE and its underlying systems like Subsystems, DeveloperSettings, Delegates & Reflection.
- Working in Unreal Engine has taught me how to work in a large, existing codebase. You learn to work with both the tools that it gives you and the constraints you face.

## Future Improvements

- Publishing plugin to FAB - This is a process I started, but haven't completed yet. Will teach me more about documenting & packaging.
- Allowing further language customization - Fully switch out keywords, implement it in your native language with full Unicode support.
