## Overview

This project was built to solve [specific problem]. It demonstrates my ability to work with modern web technologies and build scalable applications.

## Key Features

- **Feature 1**: Description of the first main feature
- **Feature 2**: Another important capability
- **Feature 3**: What makes this project special
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses WebSockets for live data
- **API Integration**: Connects to multiple third-party services

## Technical Highlights

The application uses a microservices architecture with Docker containers for easy deployment. The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework, while the frontend uses React with TypeScript.

Key technical decisions:
- Chose PostgreSQL for complex relational queries
- Implemented Redis caching to improve performance by 40%
- Used Celery for background task processing

## Challenges & Solutions

One major challenge was handling concurrent user requests during peak times. I solved this by implementing a queueing system with Celery and optimizing database queries, which reduced response time from 2s to 200ms.

## What I Learned

This project taught me a lot about system design, performance optimization, and the importance of writing maintainable code. I also gained experience with Docker orchestration and CI/CD pipelines.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication with OAuth2
- Implement a GraphQL API alongside REST
- Build a mobile app version
- Add internationalization support
